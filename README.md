# dApp-Plant-To-Earn

## Project Overview and Purpose
From the inspirations of existing model of "... to earn" with play-to-earn (AXS) and move-to-earn (GMT) has drawn a big attention from the cryptocurrency community, this project will propose a similar-but-different model of “Plant to Earn” for the purpose of environmental enhancement using blockchain and tokenomic design. The “Plant to Earn” dApp is expected to build attraction amongst nature lovers and environmental preservationists through the double purpose of using this decentralized application in planting and making profits

“Plant to Earn” is a planting decentralized application that aims to encourage the environmental contribution in tree planting with the attractive tokenomic design which can help users gain back money in the progress of donation for tree planting. The project is 100% non-profit and not designed for the financial advantage of developers when all the money surplus will be programmed to directly transfer to verified planting firms for forestation and forest recovery activities.
